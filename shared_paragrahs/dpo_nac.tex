\begin{definition}[Negative Application Condition]
    \label{def:grs:dpo_nac}
    A \textit{negative application condition} over a DPO rewriting rule $\rho$ is a monomorphisms with domain $\operatorname{lhs}(\rho)$.
\end{definition}
For a discussion on the interest of having negative applications conditions in rewriting rules, we refer the reader to \cite[\textsection 4.4.1]{ehrig1997algebraic}.
