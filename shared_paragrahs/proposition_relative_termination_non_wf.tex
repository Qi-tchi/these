\begin{proposition}[Relative termination criterion]
    \label{abstract_termination_criterion}
    Let \(\to\) and \(\leadsto\) be binary relations. \(\to\) is \textbf{terminating relative to} \(\leadsto\) if there is a function \(\mu : \mathcal{C}_0 \mathop{\to} \mathbb{R}\) such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item there is $r \mathop{\in} \mathbb{R}$ such that for all \(G \mathop{\in} \mathcal{C}_0\),
    %  we have \(\mu(G) \mathop{\in} \mathbb{R}\) and \(\mu(G) \mathop{\geq} r\),
    we have \(\mu(G) \mathop{\geq} r\), and
    \item there is $\delta \mathop{>} 0$ such that, for all \(G \mathop{\to} H\), we have \(\mu(G) \mathop{\geq} \mu(H)\mathop{+}\delta\), and
    \item for all \(G \leadsto H\), we have \(\mu(G) \mathop{\geq} \mu(H)\).
\end{itemize}
