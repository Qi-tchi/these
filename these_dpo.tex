\chapter{Introduction}
% Graph transformation systems are a formalism for modeling distributed algorithms as sets of graph rewriting rules. A graph rewriting system 
% \( \mathcal{A} \) is said to be terminating relative another graph rewriting \( \mathcal{B} \), if for any graph finite graph $G$,
% rules in $\mathcal{A}$ can only be applied finitely many times in any sequence of rule applications from $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$. 
% We study relative termination property of graph transformation systems that uses the concept of double-pushout (DPO)\textemdash a concept from the category theory\textemdash to define the transformation of graphs.
%  The contribution of this thesis is threefold. 
%  Firstly, we \textbf{extend an existing technique} that proves relative termination of such systems, known as the type graph method. Our extension enables more efficient implementation of the method. Secondly, we \textbf{develop a new machine-checkable sufficient condition} for proving relative termination of injective DPO graph rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs based on the idea of counting specific subgraphs in the graph before and after transformation. Thirdly, we \textbf{implement a termination tool}~\textbf{LyonParallel} including the existing approaches of type graph method and our extension and our termination criterion for edge-labeled directed multigraph transform. In the remainder of this chapter, we give more details on the motivation, the contributions, the structure of the thesis, and introduce the necessary background.

Systems using Subgraph Counting with antipatterns}

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\paragraph{Conclusion}
This dissertation focused on automated techniques for proving the termination of DPO graph rewriting systems.
We first extended an existing technique, the type graph method, to non-well-founded semirings, enabling more efficient implementation of the method in some cases.
We then developed a new machine-checkable sufficient condition, called subgraph counting, for proving relative termination of injective DPO graph rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs, based on counting specific subgraphs in the graph before and after transformation. This technique can handle cases that existing interpretation-based approaches cannot, such as the one in~\autoref{ex_contrib_variant}.
Finally, we extended our subgraph counting method to count specific subgraphs that are not included in forbidden contexts.

This extension successfully proves termination for systems like the ones presented 
in~\autoref{ex:grs_aca} and~\autoref{rem:d3_limitation}, which prior interpretation-based approaches~\cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,overbeek2024termination_lmcs} and the subgraph counting method presented in~\autoref{chap:subgraph_counting} fail to handle. 

The implementation of the type graph method and our extension, along with our subgraph counting technique and its extension, was integrated into a unified tool, called LyonParallel, for DPO graph rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs.
 
\paragraph{Future Wor}

Extending the type graph method to other algebraic graph rewriting formalisms, such as PBPO+, could be a promising direction.
% Extending the subgraph counting technique to count subgraphs that are not included in specific subgraphs is another interesting direction, which allows the technique to handle~\autoref{rem:d3_limitation}.

Another interesting direction is to extend the subgraph counting technique to graph rewriting systems with negative application conditions. Negative application conditions are conditions that must not be satisfied in the context of a rule application. This could lead to a more practical termination tool, as negative application conditions are often used in graph rewriting systems to express constraints on the application of rules.

It is also worth investigating the difference between our subgraph counting technique and
 the subgraph counting technique developed by Overbeek and Endrullis for PBPO+. 

The implementation of the modular termination technique proposed by Plump, which complements the type graph method and the subgraph counting technique, could be another interesting but more practical direction. This could lead to a more powerful termination tool.

Finally, confluence is another important property of graph rewriting systems, which ensures that the final result of a sequence of rewriting steps is independent of the order in which the rules are applied. Future work could explore automated techniques for proving confluence of graph rewriting systems.

% \chapter{maybe useful ??? to do}

%     \item[security protocol] The design of security protocols is notoriously error-prone. This point can be illustrated by attacks found against many published protocols. For instance, a famous attack was discovered by Lowe, 1996 against the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol (Needham and Schroeder, 1978) 17 years after its publication. Attacks are also found against many protocols used in practice. Important examples are SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security), which are used for https:// connexions. The first version dates back to 1994, and since then many attacks were discovered, fixed versions were developed, and new attacks are still regularly discovered (Beurdouche et al., 2015; Adrian et al., 2015).   <<Modeling and Verifying Security Protocols with the Applied Pi Calculus and ProVerif>> Bruno Blanchet1
