\label{chap:preliminaries}
In this chapter we recall definitions related to the double-pushout approach to edge-labeled multigraph rewriting and to relative termination. The concepts and notation in~\autoref{Preliminaries:Graphs} and~\autoref{Preliminaries:Pushout} follow the treatments in~\cite{pierce1991basic,barr1990category}; the presentation in~\autoref{sec:dpo} is based on~\cite{endrullis2024generalized_icgt}.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\paragraph{Conclusion}
This dissertation focused on automated techniques for proving the relative termination of DPO graph rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs.

We first extended an existing technique, the type graph method, to non-well-founded semirings, enabling more efficient implementation of the method in some cases.
We then developed a new machine-checkable sufficient condition, called morphism counting, for proving relative termination of injective DPO graph rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs, based on counting monomorphisms from specific subgraphs to the graph before and after transformation. This technique can handle cases, such as~\autoref{subgraph_counting:ex_contrib_variant}, that existing interpretation-based approaches cannot.
Finally, we extended our morphism counting method to count specific subgraphs that are not included in forbidden contexts. This extension successfully proves termination for systems like the ones presented
in~\autoref{antipattern:ex:grs_aca} and~\autoref{antipattern:ex:endrullis:d3:termination} which prior interpretation-based approaches~\cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,overbeek2024termination_lmcs} and the morphism counting method presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting} fail to handle.

The implementation of the type graph method and our extension, along with our morphism counting technique and its extension, was integrated into a unified tool, called LyonParallel~\footnote{LyonParallel is available at \url{https://github.com/Qi-tchi/LyonParallel/tree/icgt2025}}.
 
\paragraph{Future Work}

Extending the type graph method to other algebraic graph rewriting formalisms, such as PBPO+, could be a promising direction.

Another interesting direction is to extend the morphism counting technique to graph rewriting systems with negative application conditions. Negative application conditions are conditions that must not be satisfied in the context of a rule application. This could lead to a more practical termination tool, as negative application conditions are often used in graph rewriting systems to express constraints on the application of rules.

It is also worth investigating the difference between our morphism counting technique and
 the morphism counting technique developed by Overbeek and Endrullis for PBPO+. 
 
The implementation of the modular termination technique~\cite{plump2018modular} which complements the type graph method and the morphism counting technique, could be another interesting but more practical direction. This could lead to a more powerful termination tool.
  
Finally, confluence is another important property of graph rewriting systems, which ensures that the final result of a sequence of rewriting steps is independent of the order in which the rules are applied. Future work could explore automated techniques for proving confluence of graph rewriting systems.
