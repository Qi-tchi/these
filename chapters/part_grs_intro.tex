\subsection{The Main Ideas of the Algebraic Graph Transformation Approach}
the algebraic graph transformation approach is based on pushout constructions, where pushouts are used to model the gluing of graphs. In the algebraic approach, initiated by Ehrig, Pfender, and Schneider in [EPS73], two gluing constructions are used to model a graph transformation step, as shown in Fig. 1.4. For this reason, this approach is also known as the double-pushout (DPO) approach, in contrast to the single-pushout (SPO) approach. Both of these approaches are briefly discussed below.
