\begin{notation}
    The composition of morphisms \( f : X \to Y \) and \( g : Y \to Z \) is written in diagrammatic order as \( f \star g \), rather than in functional order \( g \circ f \). 
    % The advantage is that, when reading from left to right, the morphisms appear in the same order as in the corresponding diagram, making the notation more intuitive for visual reasoning.
