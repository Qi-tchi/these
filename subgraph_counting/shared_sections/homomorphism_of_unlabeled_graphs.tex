% A homomorphism of unlabeled graphs is a mapping between the nodes and edges of two graphs that preserves the graph structure.
% \begin{definition}
%     \label{def:unlabeled_graph:homomorphism}
%     Let \( G \) and \( H \) be unlabeled graphs. A \textbf{homomorphism of unlabeled graphs} $h: G \to H$ is a pair of functions $h_V: V(G) \to V(H) $ and $h_E: E(G) \to E(H)$ such that for every edge \( a: s \to t \) in \( G \), the edge \( h_E(a) \) is from \( h_V(s) \) to \( h_V(t) \).
% \end{definition}


% \begin{definition}
%     \label{def:graph:composition}
%     Let $f: (G,\lambda) \to (G',\lambda')$ and $g: (G',\lambda') \to (G'',\lambda'')$ be two homomorphisms of unlabeled graphs. Their composition, denoted by $g \circ f$, is defined as the pair of functions $g_V \circ f_V$ and $g_E \circ f_E$.
