\begin{definition}[\cite{barr1990category}]
    \label{def:graph:unlabeled}
    An \textbf{unlabeled graph} \( G \) consists of a collection of \textbf{nodes} (also called \textbf{objects}) and a collection of \textbf{edges}, each equipped with a \textbf{source} (or \textbf{domain}) node and a \textbf{target} (or \textbf{codomain}) node. 
    For an unlabeled graph \( G \), we denote by \( G_0 \) its collection of nodes, \( G_1 \) its collection of edges, \( \operatorname{dom}:G_1{\to}G_0 \) the domain function, and \( \operatorname{cod}:G_1{\to}G_0 \) the codomain function. An unlabeled graph is \textbf{finite} if \( G_0 \) and \( G_1 \) are both finite sets.
    We write \( a: s \to t \) to indicate that \( a \) is a directed edge from \( s \) to \( t \).
\end{definition}   

\begin{example}
    In an unlabeled graph, edges are directed and will be visualized as arrows; between any two nodes, there can be multiple edges, and loops are allowed. An unlabeled graph is depicted below where nodes are marked with numbers to facilitate discussion, but in general, nodes are not labeled.
