\begin{definition}
    \label{def:graph:unlabeled}
    An \textbf{directed unlabeled multigraph} \( G \) consists of a collection of \textbf{nodes} (also called \textbf{objects}) and a collection of \textbf{edges}, each equipped with a \textbf{source} (or \textbf{domain}) node and a \textbf{target} (or \textbf{codomain}) node. 
    An directed unlabeled multigraph is \textbf{finite} if
    it has a finite set of nodes and a finite set of edges.

    Throughout, the term \enquote{unlabeled graph} denotes a directed unlabeled multigraph.
    For an unlabeled graph \( G \), we denote by \( V(G) \) its collection of nodes, \( E(G) \) its collection of edges, \( \operatorname{dom}: E(G) {\to}V(G) \) the domain function, and \( \operatorname{cod}:E(G) {\to} V(G) \) the codomain function. 
    We write \( a: s \to t \) to indicate that \( a \) is a directed edge from \( s \) to \( t \).
\end{definition}   

Note that the collection of edges in a directed unlabeled multigraph can contain multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, as well as loops.

\begin{example}
    In an unlabeled graph, edges are directed and will be visualized as arrows; between any two nodes, there can be multiple edges, and loops are allowed. An unlabeled graph is depicted in~\autoref{fig:preliminaries:unlabeled_graph} where nodes are marked with numbers to facilitate discussion, but in general, nodes are not labeled.
