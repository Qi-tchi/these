Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting} presents an new automated method for relative termination~\cite{geser1990relative} of double-pushout (DPO) graph rewriting systems with injective rules~\cite{corradini1997algebraic,habel2001double,konig2018atutorial}. The method, based on the interpretation method framework~\cite{nipkow1998term}, works as follows. Let \( \mathbb{X} \) denote a fixed set of graphs. We assign weights (natural numbers) to monomorphisms from graphs in \( \mathbb{X} \), and define the weight of a graph $G$ as the sum of the weights of all monomorphisms from graphs in \( \mathbb{X} \) to $G$. 

Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be sets of DPO rewriting rules. Let $X \in \mathbb{X}$ and $G \Rightarrow H$ be a rewriting step defined by the double-pushouts diagram in~\autoref{fig:subgraph_counting:general_rewriting_step_sdfsl}.

For a monomorphism from $X$ to $G$, its image falls into exactly one of the following three mutually exclusive cases. First, the image may be fully included in $m(L)$. Second, the image may be fully included in $l'(C)$; Third, the image may be neither fully included in $m(L)$ nor fully included in $l'(C)$. Similary, for a monomorphism from $X$ to $H$, its image falls into exactly one of the following three mutually exclusive cases. First, the image may be fully included in $m'(R)$. Second, the image may be fully included in $r'(C)$; Third, the image may be neither fully included in $m'(R)$ nor fully included in $r'(C)$. The number of monomorphisms from $X$ to $G$ whose image is fully included in $m(L)$ can be precisely calculated, as can the number of monomorphisms from $X$ to $H$ whose image is fully included in $m'(R)$. Moreover, the number of monomorphisms from $X$ to $G$ equals to the that of monomorphisms to $H$. 

To estimate the change in weight when applying a rewriting rule, we focus on 
the monomorphisms in the third case. Specifically, our technique requires that, for every graph $X$ in $\mathbb{X}$ and every rewriting step $G \Rightarrow H$ using a rule from $\mathcal{A}$ or $\mathcal{B}$, there exists an injective mapping from the set of monomorphisms $x : X \to H$ (where $\opn{Im}(x)$ is neither fully included in the right-hand side graph nor fully included in the context) to the set of monomorphisms from $y : X \to G$ (where $\opn{Im}(y)$ is neither fully included in the left-hand side graph nor fully included in the context). 

Suppose, additionally, that the following conditions hold: (i) For every rule in \( \mathcal{A} \), the left-hand side graph's weight is strictly greater than the right-hand side graph's weight; (ii) For every rule in \( \mathcal{B} \), the left-hand side graph's weight is greater than or equal to the right-hand side graph's weight. 

Under these conditions, rewriting steps using rules in \( \mathcal{A} \) strictly decrease the weights of the host graphs, while rewriting steps using rules in \( \mathcal{B} \) do not increase them.
Consequently, the rewriting rules in \( \mathcal{A} \) can only be applied finitely many times, since the weight of a finite graph is a natural number and strictly decreases with each rewriting step using a rule in \( \mathcal{A} \), the process must terminate after finitely many iterations.

This chapter is organized as follows.
We first define the weight of a graph in~\textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:interpretation}. 
Using this definition, we outline the general approach and identify the key challenge in~\textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:general_idea} and introduce the concept of non-increasing rules in \textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:non-increasing}. 
A solution to the challenge is then proposed in~\textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:solution_to_the_key_challenge}, culminating in our termination criterion in~\textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:termination}.
\textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:examples} illustrates the method with some examples.
\textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:related_work} compares our approach with some existing methods.
Finally,~\textsection~\ref{subgraph_counting:sec:conclusion} concludes with remarks and future research directions. The missing proofs are available in 
\iflongversion
the appendix.
