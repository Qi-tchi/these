We have presented a machine-checkable sufficient condition for relative termination of DPO systems with injective rules on edge-labeled multigraphs.  
This method resolves cases where prior interpretation-based techniques \cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,
overbeek2024termination_lmcs} fail (e.g., \autoref{subgraph_counting:ex_contrib_variant}) and, unlike the subgraph-counting approach in \cite{overbeek2024termination_lmcs}, avoids limitations arising from interfaces with no edges.
The method has been implemented in an OCaml tool. 

An interesting direction for future work is to extend our method to DPO systems with negative application conditions and to address the limitation highlighted in \autoref{ex:endrullis:d3:limitation}.
