We have presented a machine-checkable sufficient condition for relative termination of DPO systems with injective rules on edge-labeled multigraphs.  
This method resolves cases where prior interpretation-based techniques \cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,
overbeek2024termination_lmcs} fail (e.g.,Example~\ref{subgraph_counting:ex_contrib_variant}) and, unlike the subgraph-counting approach in \cite{overbeek2024termination_lmcs}, avoids limitations arising from interfaces with no edges.
An implementation of the method is described in Chapter~\ref{chap:lyonparallel}.
% An interesting direction for future work is to extend our method to DPO systems with negative application conditions and to address the limitation highlighted in Example~\ref{ex:endrullis:d3:limitation}.
