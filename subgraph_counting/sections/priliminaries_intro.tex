\begin{definition}[Rewriting framework \cite{endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2}]
    A \textbf{DPO rewriting framework} $\mathfrak{F}$ is a mapping of DPO rewriting rules to classes of DPO diagrams such that, for every rule $\rho$, $\mathfrak{F}(\rho)$ is a class of DPO diagrams with top-span $\rho$.
    The \textbf{DPO rewriting relation $\Rightarrow_{\rho,\mathfrak{F}}$ induced by a DPO rewriting rule $\rho$ in $\mathfrak{F}$} is defined as follows: $G \Rightarrow_{\rho,\mathfrak{F}} H$ iff $G \Rightarrow_\rho^\delta H$ for some $\delta \in \mathfrak{F}(\rho)$. 
    % for some $\delta \in \mathfrak{F}(\rho)$
     The \textbf{DPO rewriting relation $\Rightarrow_{\mathcal{R},\mathfrak{F}}$ induced by a set $\mathcal{R}$ of DPO rewriting rules in $\mathfrak{F}$} is given by: $G \Rightarrow_{\mathcal{R},\mathfrak{F}} H$ iff $G \Rightarrow_{\rho,\mathfrak{F}} H$ for some $\rho \in \mathcal{R}$. When $\mathfrak{F}$ is clear from the context, we 
    suppress $\mathfrak{F}$ and 
    write $\Rightarrow_{\rho}$ and $\Rightarrow_{\mathcal{R}}$.
  \end{definition}
Let \(\mathfrak{F}\) denote the DPO rewriting framework that associates any rule with the class of all DPO diagrams with the rule as the top span, and let \(\mathfrak{M}\) denote the DPO rewriting framework that associates any rule with the class of all DPO diagrams having monic matches and the rule as the top span.
