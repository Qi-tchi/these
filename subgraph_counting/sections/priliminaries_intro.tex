We recall some definitions related to the double-pushout approach to edge-labeled directed multigraph rewriting and relative termination. For more detailed information, we refer the reader to~\cite{konig2018atutorial,corradini1997algebraic} for the double-pushout approach to edge-labeled multigraphs rewriting,~\cite{pierce1991basic,barr1990category} for category theory concepts, and~\cite{geser1990relative} for relative termination.
