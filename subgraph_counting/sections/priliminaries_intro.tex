    A \textbf{DPO rewriting framework} $\mathfrak{F}$ is a mapping of DPO rewriting rules to collections of DPO diagrams. Specifically, for every rule \( \rho = (L \overset{l}{\leftarrow} K \overset{r}{\rightarrow} R) \), the collection $\mathfrak{F}(\rho)$ consists of DPO diagrams of the form shown below.

    The \textbf{DPO rewriting relation $\Rightarrow_{\rho,\mathfrak{F}}$ induced by a DPO rewriting rule $\rho$ in $\mathfrak{F}$} is defined as follows: $G \Rightarrow_{\rho,\mathfrak{F}} H$ iff $G \Rightarrow_\rho^\delta H$ for some $\delta \in \mathfrak{F}(\rho)$. 
     The \textbf{DPO rewriting relation $\Rightarrow_{\mathcal{R},\mathfrak{F}}$ induced by a set $\mathcal{R}$ of DPO rewriting rules in $\mathfrak{F}$} is given by: $G \Rightarrow_{\mathcal{R},\mathfrak{F}} H$ iff $G \Rightarrow_{\rho,\mathfrak{F}} H$ for some $\rho \in \mathcal{R}$. When $\mathfrak{F}$ is clear from the context, we 
    suppress $\mathfrak{F}$ and 
    write $\Rightarrow_{\rho}$ and $\Rightarrow_{\mathcal{R}}$.

Let \(\mathfrak{F}\) denote the DPO rewriting framework that associates each rule \( \rho = (L \overset{l}{\leftarrow} K \overset{r}{\rightarrow} R) \) with the collection of all DPO diagrams of the form shown in~\autoref{def:rewriting_framework}.
Let \(\mathfrak{M}\) denote the DPO rewriting framework that associates each rule with the collection of all DPO diagrams of the following form with monic match $m$.
