\begin{notation}
    When the context makes it clear, a morphism \( h : A \mathop{\to} B \) will be denoted by \( h_{AB} \), and diagrams will be referred to by their nodes, as is standard in geometry. For example, the diagram involving the morphisms \( \alpha, \beta, \alpha', \beta' \) in Definition~\ref{def:cat:po} will be denoted by \( ACDB \) or \( ABDC \).
