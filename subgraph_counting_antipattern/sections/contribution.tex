Prior versions of the type graph method~\cite{bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2023generalized} fail to establish termination of the graph rewriting system presneted in~\autorefbrackets{ex_contrib}. This limitation arises due to the existence of surjective homomorphisms from the output graph to the input graph, as noted in~\cite{endrullis2023generalized}. In~\cite{plump2018modular}, Plump uses the measure $\sum_{v\in V_G} \operatorname{indegree}(v)^k$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$ to prove termination. Its termination can also be proved by the method proposed in~\cite{overbeek2023termination}.
