The following lemma ensures that if $\rho$ is $X$-non-increasing, then, for any rewriting step using $\rho$, the cardinality of the set of \( X \)-occurrences implicitly destroyed by the rewriting step is at least as large as the cardinality of the set of \( X \)-occurrences implicitly created by the rewriting step.
