We have extended our subgraph counting method.
The extension resolves cases where prior interpretation-based techniques~\cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,overbeek2024termination_lmcs}
and the original version of our subgraph counting method in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting}
fail such as Examples~\ref{antipattern:ex:grs_aca} and~\ref{antipattern:ex:endrullis:d3:termination}.
The method has been implemented in the tool presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:lyonparallel}.

% Interesting directions for future work are to generalize our subgraph counting method to count subgraphs with multiple forbidden contexts, to understand the difference between the subgraph counting method presented in this chapter and that in~\cite{overbeek2024termination_lmcs} to provide a more general termination criterion that leverages the strengths of both methods for DPO rewriting systems, and to extend it to DPO systems with negative application conditions.
