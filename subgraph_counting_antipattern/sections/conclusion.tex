We have extended our morphism counting method to handle cases such as 
Examples~\ref{antipattern:ex:grs_aca} and~\ref{antipattern:ex:endrullis:d3:termination} for which both the method of Overbeek and Endrullis~\cite{overbeek2024termination_lmcs} and the morphism counting method of Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting} fail. These failures arise when there exists an injectif morphism from a rule's left-hand side graph into its right-hand side graph. The extended method has been implemented in the tool described in Chapter~\ref{chap:lyonparallel}.
