We have extended our subgraph counting method.
The extension resolves cases where prior interpretation-based techniques~\cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,overbeek2024termination_lmcs}
and the original version of our subgraph method in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting}
fail such as~\autoref{antipattern:ex:grs_aca} and~\autoref{antipattern:ex:endrullis:d3:termination} and, unlike the subgraph-counting approach in~\cite{overbeek2024termination_lmcs}.
The method has been implemented in an OCaml tool.

Interesting directions for future work are to generalize our subgraph counting method to count subgraphs with multiple forbidden contexts and to
 extend it to DPO systems with negative application conditions.
