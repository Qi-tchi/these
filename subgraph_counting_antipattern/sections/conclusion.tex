We have extended our subgraph-counting method to handle cases such as 
Examples~\ref{antipattern:ex:grs_aca} and~\ref{antipattern:ex:endrullis:d3:termination} where both the method of Overbeek and Endrullis~\cite{overbeek2024termination_lmcs} and the morphism counting method of Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting} fail. These failures arise when there exists an injection from a rule's left-hand side graph into its right-hand side graph. The extended method has been implemented in the tool described in Chapter~\ref{chap:lyonparallel}.
% Interesting directions for future work are to generalize our subgraph counting method to count subgraphs with multiple forbidden contexts, to understand the difference between the subgraph counting method presented in this chapter and that in~\cite{overbeek2024termination_lmcs} to provide a more general termination criterion that leverages the strengths of both methods for DPO rewriting systems, and to extend it to DPO systems with negative application conditions.
