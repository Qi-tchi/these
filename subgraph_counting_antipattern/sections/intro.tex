This chapter extends the subgraph counting method presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting}. This extension counts occurrences of given graphs while excluding those that overlap with forbidden contexts.
It successfully proves termination for systems like the ones presented 
in~\autoref{antipattern:ex:grs_aca} and~\autoref{antipattern:ex:endrullis:d3:termination}, which prior interpretation-based approaches~\cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,overbeek2024termination_lmcs} and the subgraph counting method presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting} fail to handle. 
Additionally, we provide an implementation of our technique.

We are going to preceed as follows:~\textsection~\ref{antipattern:sec:termination_criterion} presents the extension.~\textsection~\ref{antipattern:sec:examples} provides some examples,~\textsection~\ref{antipattern:sec:conclusion} concludes. Missing proofs and definitions are in the appendix.
