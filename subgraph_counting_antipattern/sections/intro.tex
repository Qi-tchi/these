Consider the following DPO rewriting rule:

          \node[draw,circle] (l2) at ($(l1)+(2,0)$) {2};

In this system, the number of monomorphisms from every possible pattern graph increases with each application of the rewriting rule. Therefore, the method introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting} cannot be applied. However, the number of monomorphisms from the graph
\raisebox{2pt}{
            \scalebox{0.7}{\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{
            \node [draw,circle] (z) at (-1,0) {};
            \node [draw,circle] (x) at (0,0) {};
            \node[draw,circle] (y) at (1,0) {};
            \draw[->] (z)--(x) node[midway, above] {$a$};
            \draw[->] (x)--(y) node[midway, above] {$a$};
        }}} 
    whose images are not included in occurrences of the graph
        \raisebox{2pt}{
            \scalebox{0.7}{\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{
            \node [draw,circle] (z) at (-1,0) {};
            \node [draw,circle] (x) at (0,0) {};
            \node[draw,circle] (y) at (1,0) {};
            \draw[->] (z)--(x) node[midway, above] {$a$};
            \draw[->] (x)--(y) node[midway, above] {$a$};
            \draw[->] (x) edge [loop below] node {$c$} (l3);
        }}}
strictly decreases with each application of the rewriting rule.

We formalize this intuition by using the concept of \textit{forbidden contexts} and extend the morphism counting method presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting} to count only those monomorphisms whose images are not included in any forbidden contexts.

This extension can handle systems (e.g., Example~\ref{antipattern:ex:grs_aca} and Example~\ref{antipattern:ex:endrullis:d3:termination}) that cannot be handled by the
prior interpretation-based approaches~\cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,overbeek2024termination_lmcs} and by the morphism counting method presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:subgraph_counting}.
An implementation of this extension is described in Chapter~\ref{chap:lyonparallel}.

This chapter is organized as follows:~\textsection~\ref{antipattern:sec:termination_criterion} presents the extension, and~\textsection~\ref{antipattern:sec:examples} provides some examples. Proofs of some propositions, lemmas, and theorems of this chapter have been moved to Appendix~\ref{antipattern:sec:appendix} to improve readability.
