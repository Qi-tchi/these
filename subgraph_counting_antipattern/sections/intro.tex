This chapter extends the subgraph counting method presented in~\autoref{chap:subgraph_counting}. This extension counts occurrences of given graphs while excluding those that overlap with forbidden contexts.
It successfully proves termination for systems like the ones presented 
in~\autoref{ex:grs_aca} and~\autoref{rem:d3_limitation}, which prior interpretation-based approaches~\cite{zantema2014termination,bruggink2014termination,bruggink2015proving,endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2,overbeek2024termination_lmcs} and the subgraph counting method presented in~\autoref{chap:subgraph_counting} fail to handle. 
Additionally, we provide an implementation of our technique.

We are going to preceed as follows:
~\autoref{sec:subgraph_counting_antipattern:termination_criterion} presents the extension.
~\autoref{sec:subgraph_counting_antipattern:examples} provides some examples,
% ~\autoref{sec:subgraph_counting_antipattern:related_work} discusses related work, and
~\autoref{sec:subgraph_counting_antipattern:conclusion} concludes. Missing proofs and definitions are in the appendix.
