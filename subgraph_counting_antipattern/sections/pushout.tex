% We adopt the presentation from~\cite{barr1990category}, where a category is viewed as an unlabeled directed graph~\autorefbrackets{def:cat} equipped with two additional functions and their associated properties. In this framework, a homomorphism~\autorefbrackets{def:cat:homo} is simply another term for an arrow. To enhance readability, we utilize the concepts of spans and cospans. After introducing the notion of a commutative diagram~\autorefbrackets{def:cat:diagram}, we proceed to define the pushout~\autorefbrackets{def:cat:po_pb}. The construction of pushouts in the category \textbf{Graph} is also explain.
% To establish the categorical foundations necessary for our work, we recall key concepts such as monomorphisms, spans, cospans, commutative diagrams, and pushouts, following the presentation in~\cite{barr1990category}. We then focus on pushouts with monomorphisms within the category of graphs.
