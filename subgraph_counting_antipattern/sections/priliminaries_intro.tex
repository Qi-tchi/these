\todo{Most members of the CADE audience will not be familiar with notions
specific to graph rewriting. This means that in a paper on the
analysis of graph rewriting rules that is presented at CADE, these
notions will need to be illustrated by appropriate intuition and
concrete examples.} We recall some definitions related to the double-pushout approach to edge-labeled directed multigraphs rewriting and relative termination. For more detailed information, we refer the reader to~\cite{konig2018atutorial,ehrig1997algebraic} for the double-pushout approach to edge-labeled multigraphs rewriting, \textsection~\ref{appendix:category}, \textsection~\ref{appendix:category_adhesive} and~\cite{pierce1991basic, barr1990category} for category theory concepts, and~\cite{geser1990relative} for relative termination.
