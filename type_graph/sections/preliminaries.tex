%  We first introduce the concept of pushout from category theory in \hyperref[preliminaries:pushout]{Section~\ref*{preliminaries:pushout}}. 
%   Next, we discuss the double-pushout (DPO) rewriting in \hyperref[preliminaries:grs]{Section~\ref*{preliminaries:grs}}. 
%   Finally, we explore the concept of relative termination in \hyperref[preliminaries:relative_termination]{Section~\ref*{preliminaries:relative_termination}}. 
%   Additionally, we introduce the notion of a strongly monotonic measurable semiring in \hyperref[sec:strongly_monotonic_measurable_semiring]{Section~\ref*{sec:strongly_monotonic_measurable_semiring}}. 
%   The type graph, which is presented in \hyperref[sec:weighted_type_graph]{Section~\ref*{sec:weighted_type_graph}}, is weighted over this semiring.
  
In this section, we recall definitions related to the double-pushout approach to graph rewriting and relative termination, and we introduce strongly monotonic measurable semirings. For further details, we refer the reader to~\cite{konig2018atutorial,corradini1997algebraic,habel2001double} for the DPO graph rewriting,~\cite{pierce1991basic, barr1990category} for category theory concepts, and~\cite{geser1990relative} for relative termination. Basic concepts in the category theory and on edge-labeled graphs needed in this paper are collected in the preliminaries section of \cite{qiu2025termination}.

\subsection{DPO rewriting}
\label{preliminaries:grs}

DPO rewriting has several variants, depending on factors such as whether the matching morphism, the left-hand morphism, or the right-hand morphism is monic~\cite{habel2001double}, and whether the left pushout square is restricted~\cite{behr2021concurrency,behr2023fundamentals}. Since these restrictions can influence the termination properties of a DPO rewrite system,  we use the definition from~\cite{endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2} to encompass different DPO variants.
