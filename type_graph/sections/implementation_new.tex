We have implemented both our approach and the one proposed by Endrullis and Overbeek~\cite{endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2} for edge-labeled DPO rewriting systems into a unified tool. These two approaches can be launched in parallel and collaborate to establish termination of a DPO rewriting system. 
\paragraph{Searching Strategy.}
Consider a DPO rewriting system $\mathcal{R}$. Given a fixed semiring $S$, a processor is spawned to iteratively search for a suitable weighted type graph over $S$.
The search starts with a weighted type graph containing 1 node, incrementally increasing the node count by 1 until a maximum of 4 nodes is reached.
For a fixed number of nodes,
 if $S$ is a semiring over the natural numbers, the maximum edge weight is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 (up to a limit of 3) if no suitable weighted type graph is found;
if $S$ is a semiring over the real numbers, the search is performed over all real numbers.
Processors targeting different semirings can run in parallel to analyze the same DPO rewriting system.
When a processor discovers a weighted type graph that witnesses relative termination of a subset of rules $\mathcal{A}$ with respect to another subset of rules $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$, it broadcasts this result to all processors and waits for them to terminate. If $\mathcal{B} = \emptyset$, the system's termination is proven. Otherwise, we initiate a new search for the rules in $\mathcal{B}$ unless a timeout is reached.
 
For a fixed number of nodes $k$, we adopt the approach proposed in \cite{bruggink2015proving, bruggink2014termination,zantema2014termination} to reduce the search space. Specifically, we construct a weighted type graph with
% \( \mathcal{T}=(T, \mathbb{E}, S, w) \) where: (1) the type graph $T$ has 
$k$ nodes and no parallel edges of the same label.
%  and (2) the set $\mathbb{E}$ of morphism-rulers consists of identity morphisms from subgraphs of the type graph $T$ (each is a labeled edge with its incident nodes) to the type graph $T$.
The search proceeds as follows: 
(1) decide if $s \overset{l}{\to} t$ exists for every pair of nodes \( s, t\) and label \( l\); (2) assign a weight to every existing edge
(3)
%  Check if the weighted type graph satisfy requirements
% (1) construct a graph with \( k \) nodes and no parallel edges of the same label, which has a directed edge from node $s$ to node $t$ labeled by $l$ for each ordered pair $(s,t)$ of nodes and label $l$ from the finite set of edge labels $\Sigma$ of the rewriting system; (2) decide whether each edge exists in the weighted type graph; (3) assign a weight (a natural number or a real number according to $S$) to every existing edge; (4) 
verify the existence of a constant $\delta >0$ and a partition of the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ into a non-empty subset $\mathcal{A}$ and a subset $\mathcal{B}$
 such that: (i) either all rules in $\mathcal{A}$ are $\delta$-uniformly decreasing or all rules in $\mathcal{A}$ are $\delta$-closure decreasing, and all rules in $\mathcal{B}$ are weakly decreasing.
This procedure can reduced to checking the satisfiability of an existential Presburger arithmetic, Peano arithmetic, linear real arithmetic, or non-linear real arithmetic formula depending on the semiring $S$ considered.
  
\emph{Z3 Modeling.} 
The type graph $T$ is modeled in Z3 by defining a Boolean variable $x_{u,v,l} \in \mathbb{B}$ for every directed labeled edge $u\overset{l}{\to} v$ in the type graph, where $u,v\in\{1,...,k\}$ are nodes and $l \in \Sigma$ is an edge label. The variable $x_{u,v,l}$ has the value \enquote{true} if the directed edge $u\overset{l}{\to} v$ exists in the result type graph, \enquote{false} otherwise.

The weight function $w$ and the set $\mathbb{E}$ of morphism-rulers are modeled in Z3 by defining a variable $y_{u,v,l}$ in $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, depending on the semiring $\mathcal{S}$ considered,
 for every pair $u,v\in\{1,...,k\}$ of nodes and edge label $l \in \Sigma$. 
The variable $y_{u,v,l}$ represents the weight of the directed labeled edge $u\overset{l}{\to} v$ in the resulting weighted type graph, but only if edge $u\overset{l}{\to} v$ exists (i.e. $x_{u,v,l}$ has the value \enquote{true}).

A variable $\delta \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is defined to ensure that there is
a partition of the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ into a non-empty subset $\mathcal{A}$ and a subset $\mathcal{B}$ such that all rules in $\mathcal{A}$ are either $\delta$-uniformly decreasing or $\delta$-closure decreasing, and all rules in $\mathcal{B}$ are weakly decreasing.

For convenience, the following auxiliary variables are also defined: a Boolean variable $v_h \in \mathbb{B}$ for every morphism $h$ from $L$ or $R$ to $T$; a real-valued variable $v_{h'} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ for every morphism $h$ from $L$ or $R$ to $T$; a Boolean variable $v_c \in \mathbb{B}$ for every morphism $c$ from $L$ to $T$.

The value of $v_h$ has the value \enquote{true} if the morphism $h$ exists in the result type graph (i.e. all edges in its image exist), and \enquote{false} otherwise.
The variable $v_{h'}$ holds the weight of the morphism $h$, provided the morphism $h$ exists (i.e., $v_h$ is true).
The variable $v_c$ has the value \enquote{true} if the morphism $c$ exists in the result type graph and can serve as a context closure for the rule, and \enquote{false} otherwise.

If there exists an assignment of values to \( (x_{u,v,l})_{u,v \in \{1,...,k\}, l \in \Sigma} \), \( (y_{u,v,l})_{u,v \in \{1,...,k\}, l \in \Sigma} \) and $\delta$ such that all conditions of Theorem~\ref{nwf:thm:termination_grs} are satisfied, then a suitable weighted type graph that witnesses termination of the DPO rewriting system can be constructed: the values of \( (x_{u,v,l})_{u,v \in \{1,...,k\}, l \in \Sigma} \) define the type graph $T$; the values of \( (y_{u,v,l})_{u,v \in \{1,...,k\}, l \in \Sigma} \) define the weight function $w$ and the set $\mathbb{E}$ of morphism-rulers.
