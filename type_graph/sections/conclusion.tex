The type graph method is a technique for proving termination of DPO rewriting systems. 
To apply this method, one needs to construct a weighted type graph over a semiring that witnesses termination of the rewriting system, and three concrete well-founded semirings over the natural numbers have been proposed in prior work: the tropical semiring, the arctic semiring, and the arithmetic semiring.
However, constructing suitable weighted type graphs over these concrete semirings for DPO rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs is difficult. 
To address this challenge, we investigate weighted type graphs over non-well-founded semirings, and propose three corresponding concrete semirings over the real numbers: the tropical semiring, the arctic semiring, and the arithmetic semiring. Construction of weighted type graphs over these concrete semirings is computationally easier.
    
We implemented both our approach and the one proposed by Endrullis and Overbeek~\cite{endrullis2024generalized_arxiv_v2} for DPO rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs into a unified tool. Experiments show that for the tropical and arctic semirings, the weighted type graphs over semirings over the real numbers can be constructed more easily, but for the arithmetic semiring, the weighted type graphs over semirings over the real numbers are more difficult to construct than those over the natural numbers.
