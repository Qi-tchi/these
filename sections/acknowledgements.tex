First of all, I thank my supervisor, Xavier Urbain, for providing me with the opportunity to work on this subject and for
 his guidance not only in my research but more importantly in my personal development. His integrity is a great example for me to follow. At the midpoint of my PhD, we had differing opinions regarding the research direction, and he generously allowed me to pursue my own path. This freedom has been invaluable to me, and I am grateful for his kindness.

I extend my sincere thanks to all the faculty members who contributed to my academic development during my studies in France for their generosity in sharing knowledge and their kindness and patience towards their students impressed me deeply.

I thank the anonymous reviewers of my works for their time and valuable feedback; Zhilin Wu for his suggestion on the general structure of the thesis; Pierre Courtieu for his help in the early stages of my PhD.

I thank my parents, Shuangluan Ye and Guowen Qiu, for their unconditional love and sacrifices throughout my adventure for so many years, and my wife, Lu Wang, for her patience and understanding during the challenging times of my PhD.

I thank my friends Pierre, Thomas, Auday, Yacine, Medhi, Zhongyun, Wei, Xin, Chukun and all those who have occurred in my life, as each person has played a role in shaping who I am today. 

Of course, I thank myself for my perseverance and determination during my 12 year adventure in France. I failed many times, but I never gave up. I learned from my mistakes and kept moving forward. I finally achieved my goal of becoming someone like Emile as described in the book \enquote{Emile, or On Education} by Jean-Jacques Rousseau who is a person of integrity and is useful to society.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the French National Research Agency (ANR) for funding the project Safe, Adaptive, and Provable Protocols for Oblivious Robots Operation (SAPPORO) under Grant 2019-CE25-0005, which has provided essential resources and support for my research endeavors.
