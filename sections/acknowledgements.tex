I thank my supervisor, Xavier Urbain, for providing me with the opportunity to work on this passionate subject and for
 his guidance not only in my research but more importantly in my personal development. 
His integrity is a great example for me to follow.

 At the midpoint of my PhD, we had differing opinions  regarding the research direction, and he generously allowed me to pursue my own path based on my academic instincts. This freedom has been invaluable to me, and I am grateful for his kindness.


I thank Zhilin Wu for his suggestion on the general structure of the thesis.

I thank Pierre Courtieu for his help in the early stages of my PhD.

I thank my parents and wife for their unwavering support. 

I thank Pierre, Thomas, Yacine, Medhi, Auday, Zhongyun, Wei, Xin, Chukun and all those who have occurred in my life, as each person has played a role in shaping who I am today.

I thank the anonymous reviewers of my works for their valuable feedback. 

I extend my sincere thanks to all the faculty members who contributed to my academic development during my studies in France for their generosity in sharing knowledge and their kindness and patience towards their students impressed me deeply.
