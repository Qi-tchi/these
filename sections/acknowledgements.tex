First of all, I thank my supervisor, Xavier Urbain, for providing me with the opportunity to work on this subject and for his guidance not only in my research but, more importantly, in my personal development: his integrity is a great example for me to follow. At the midpoint of my PhD, we had different opinions regarding the research direction, and he generously allowed me to pursue the path which inspired me the most. This freedom has been invaluable to me, and I am grateful for his kindness.

I extend my sincere thanks to all the faculty members who contributed to my academic development during my studies in France, for their generosity in sharing knowledge, and for their kindness and patience towards their students, all of which greatly influenced my personal growth.

I thank the anonymous reviewers of my work for their time and valuable feedback; Zhilin Wu for his suggestion on the general structure of this dissertation; and Pierre Courtieu for his help in the early stages of my PhD.

I thank my parents, Shuangluan Ye and Guowen Qiu, for their unconditional love and sacrifices that have allowed me to pursue my dreams, and my wife, Wang Lu, for her patience and understanding during the challenging times of my PhD.

I thank my friends Pierre, Thomas, Auday, Medhi, Yacine, Zhongyun, Wei, Chukun, Xin, and all those who have come into my life, as each person has played a role in shaping who I am today.

I'm also grateful to the large language model that helped me in writing on a daily basis. Thanks to its tireless proofreading, I was able to avoid burdening the people closest to me with endless revisions.

% Of course, I thank myself for my perseverance and determination during my adventure in France. I failed many times, but I never gave up. I learned from my mistakes and kept moving forward. I finally achieved my goal of becoming someone like Émile as described in the book \enquote{Émile ou De l'éducation} by Jean-Jacques Rousseau who is a person of integrity and is useful to the society.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the French National Research Agency (ANR) for funding the project Safe, Adaptive, and Provable Protocols for Oblivious Robots Operation (SAPPORO) under Grant 2019-CE25-0005, which has provided essential resources and support for my research endeavors.
