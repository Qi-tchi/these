First of all, I thank my supervisor, Xavier Urbain, for providing me with the opportunity to work on this subject and for his guidance not only in my research but, more importantly, in my personal development: his integrity is a great example for me to follow. At the midpoint of my PhD, we had different opinions regarding the research direction, and he generously allowed me to pursue the path which inspired me the most. This freedom has been invaluable to me, and I am grateful for his kindness.

I thank Evelyne Contejean and Victor Ostromoukhov for serving as members of the \enquote{Comité de Suivi de Thèse}; Pierre Courtieu for his help in the early stages of my PhD and his kindness which impressed me deeply; Rachid Echahed and Nicolas Peltier for hosting me as temporary teaching and research associate (ATER) at the University of Grenoble Alpes,
 and for the guidance and working conditions they provided;
Tom Hirschowitz for his invitation to give a talk at the University of Chambéry, which meant a lot to me as a follower of Jean-Jacques Rousseau; 
Zhilin Wu for asking thoughtful questions about the structure of the dissertation's first draft; the anonymous reviewers of my work for their time and valuable feedback.

I extend my sincere thanks to all the faculty members who contributed to my academic development during my studies in France, for their generosity in sharing knowledge, and for their kindness and patience towards their students, all of which greatly influenced my personal growth.

I thank my parents, Shuangluan Ye and Guowen Qiu, for their unconditional love and sacrifices that have allowed me to pursue my dreams. I also thank my wife, Lu Wang, for her patience and understanding during the challenging times of my PhD.

I thank my friend Pierre Bourquat, the most authentic person I have ever met. I still remember one day at the very beginning of my PhD, when I was working in my cubicle alone, he gently tapped on the glass side of my cubicle and asked me if I was new ... then introduced me to other friends Thomas Ranvier, Auday Berro, Mehdi Hennequin and Yacine Gaci. I also thank Zhongyun Yang, Yaqing Fang, Jiayi Wei, Chukun Zhang, Xin Xie, Fang Wan and all those who have come into my life, as each person has played a role in shaping who I am today.
