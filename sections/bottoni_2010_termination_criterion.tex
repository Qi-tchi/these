\begin{definition}
    Let $V_L$ be the set of nodes in $L$, and $M_L \mathop{=} \{m_1, \dots, m_r\}$ the set of matches $m_i : V_L \mathop{\to} V_L$ of $V_L$ into itself, including the identity $id_{V_L} \mathop{=} m_1$. We construct a Labelled Transition System $\mathcal{L}^p \mathop{=} (S, \Lambda, \longrightarrow)$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $S$ contains a state $s_i$ for each graph 
        $H_i^p \mathop{\in} \mathfrak{H}_p^p$. 
        % $H_i^p \mathop{\in} \mathscr{H}$.
         Each $s_i$ induces a classification function $c_i$ for matches of $p$ such that $c_i(m_l) \mathop{=} \text{true}$ iff $m_l$ can be extended to a match on $H_i^p$, but not to a match on any other 
         $H_j^p \mathop{\in} \mathfrak{H}_p^p \mathop{\setminus} (\{H_1^p, H_i^p\} \mathop{\cup} \{H_t^p \mathop{\mid} \exists h_t^i : H_t^p \mathop{\to} H_i^p\})$,
          i.e., $H_i^p$ is the biggest graph to which $m_l$ can be extended.
        
        \item $\Lambda$ contains a label $p^i$, $i \mathop{=} 1, \dots, r$ for each morphism in $M_L$.
        
        \item The transition relation $\longrightarrow \mathop{\subseteq} S \mathop{\times} \Lambda \mathop{\times} S$ is such that $(s_i, p^l, s_j) \mathop{\in} \longrightarrow$ (denoted by $s_i \xrightarrow{p^l} s_j$) if applying $p$ with match $m_l$ on graph $H_i^p$ produces a graph for which $c_j(m_l) \mathop{=} \text{true}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition} 

\begin{definition}
    In order to consider the variation on the number of possible matches induced by the application of $p$ on the minimal context for a given state, let $@|\cdot|: S \mathop{\to} \mathbb{N}$ be a function which associates with each state $s_i$ the number of matches for $p$ on the graph $H_i^p$ prior to application of $p$, and with $|\cdot|: S \mathop{\to} \mathbb{N}$ the function defining the number of matches on $H_i^p$ after the application of $p$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\rho$ be a graph rewriting rule. We say that $\rho$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{must terminate} if it should terminate simply and for all transitions $s_i \xrightarrow{p_l} s_j$ and all states $s_h \mathop{\neq} s_i, s_j, s_k$, we have $\left| s_i \right| < @ | s_i |$, $\left| s_j \right| \leq @ | s_j |\mathop{+}1$ and $\left| s_h \right| \leq @ | s_h |$.
        \item \emph{may terminates} if it may terminate simply and for all states on the path the same condition on matches as above applies.
        \item \emph{does not terminate} if (it does not terminate simply AND for all states from which $s_k$ is reachable, there is a state for which the number of matches increases for some transition leading to $s_k$ increases) OR (it should or may terminate simply, but there is at least one state $s_i$ on a path from $s_1$ to $s_k$ for which $\left| s_i \right| \mathop{\geq} @ | s_i |$, for a transition reachable from state $s_i$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Termination~\text{\cite[Theorem~2]{bottoni2010atermination}}]
    \todo{rewrite}
    Let $@|\cdot|: S \mathop{\to} \mathbb{N}$ and $|\cdot|: S \mathop{\to} \mathbb{N}$ be counting functions as defined above, let $p$ be a rule, and let $G$ be a finite graph. Then the following holds:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If rule $p$ is of type \textbf{must terminate}, then the application of \texttt{asLongAsPossible $p$ end} on the starting graph $G$ terminates after a finite number of steps.
        
        \item If $p$ is of type \textbf{does not terminate}, then the application of \texttt{asLongAsPossible $p$ end} on the starting graph $G$ does not terminate.
    \end{enumerate}
