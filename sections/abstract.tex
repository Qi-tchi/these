Graph rewriting systems are formal models that describe how graphs can be transformed by applying a set of transformation rules. The field of automated termination analysis of graph rewriting systems studies techniques for proving that a graph rewriting system terminates, meaning that, for any graph, the application of its transformation rules cannot last indefinitely.

This thesis focuses on the development of automatic techniques for the termination analysis of graph rewriting systems based on the double-pushout (DPO) approach. Its contributions are divided into four phases:

Firstly, we extend an existing technique, called the type graph method. The type graph method assigns weights to morphisms targeting a weighted type graph over a semiring, and the weight of a graph is defined as the sum of the weights of all morphisms from that graph to the type graph. The termination property is then proved by showing that the weight of the graph strictly decreases with each application of a transformation rule if the set of weights is well-founded.
Requiring the weights to be well-founded can, however, have practical limitations because the complexity of searching for a suitable type graph is extremely high.
Our extension addresses this challenge by permitting the use of weights from non-well-founded semirings.
This enables more efficient implementation of the method in practice in some cases.

Secondly, we develop a new sufficient condition, called Morphism Counting, for DPO graph rewriting systems with injective rules on edge-labeled directed multigraphs. It is based on the idea that the transformation cannot last indefinitely if the number of morphismes from a specific subgraph to the target graph decreases every time a transformation is performed.

Thirdly, we extend Morphism Counting for finer-grained analysis. Specifically: termination is established by tracking morphisms from a specific subgraph to the target graph and whose image is not contained in a forbidden context.

Finally, we developed LyonParallel, an automated termination verification tool dedicated to DPO rewriting of edge-labeled directed multigraphs. This tool integrates both the type graph method and our extension, as well as the Morphism Counting technique and its extension.
