Graph rewriting systems are formal models that describe how graphs can be transformed by applying a set of rules. The field of automated termination analysis of graph rewriting systems studies techniques for proving that a graph rewriting system terminates, meaning that, for any graph, the application of its transformation rules cannot last indefinitely. The contribution of this thesis is fourfold.

Firstly, we extend an existing technique, called the type graph method, for graph rewriting systems based on the double-pushout (DPO) approach. The type graph method assigns weights to morphisms targeting a weighted type graph over a semiring, and the weight of a graph is defined as the sum of the weights of all morphisms from that graph to the type graph. The termination property is then proved by showing that the weight of the graph strictly decreases with each application of a transformation rule if the set of weights is well-founded. 
However, requiring the weights to be well-founded can have practical limitations because the complexity of searching for a suitable type graph is extremely high.
Our extension addresses this challenge by permitting the use of weights from non-well-founded semirings.
This enables more efficient implementation of the method in practice in some cases.

Secondly, we develop a new machine-checkable sufficient condition, called Morphism Counting, for injective DPO graph rewriting systems on edge-labeled directed multigraphs. It is based on the idea that the transformation cannot last indefinitely if the number of morphismes from a specific subgraph to the target graph decreases every time a transformation is performed.

Thirdly, we extend our Morphism Counting method. The extension can establish the termination property of a DPO graph rewriting system by analyzing the decrease in the number of morphismes from specific subgraphs whose images are not embedded within forbidden contexts.

Finally, we have implemented an automated termination tool, called LyonParallel, 
for the transformation of edge-labeled directed multigraphs using DPO.
This tool includes both the existing type graph method (and our extension) and the Morphism Counting technique (and its extension).
