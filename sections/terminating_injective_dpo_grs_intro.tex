\begin{itemize}
    \item This part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of terminating injective DPO graph rewriting systems.
    \item Since~\autoref{part:morphisms_from_gls_to_grs} has introduced morphisms from graph relabeling systems to injective DPO graph rewriting systems on graphs, the terminating methods developed in this part can be applied to graph relabeling systems.
    \item This part is organized as follows: todo todo \todo{todo}
