\begin{itemize}
    \item This part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of morphisms from graph relabeling systems to term rewriting systems.
    \item Motivation: term rewriting systems are special cases of rewriting systems applied to terms, on which advanced techniques for proving termination is the most studied relative to other rewriting systems.
